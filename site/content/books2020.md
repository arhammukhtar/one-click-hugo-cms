## 2020

### March

1. Me Talk Pretty One Day (2000) - David Sedaris #  
An essay collection of the author's recollections of his early life, most focus is on the time he spent in France. Some of them are very funny while others have a hint of melencholy. Short book around 280 pages, makes for a quick read.
2. Of Mice and Men (1937) - John Steinbeck  
Short novella of some 103 pages. I don't find Steinbeck's writing easy to read.
3. Sh≈çgun (1975) - James Clavell #  
An epic adventure historical fiction. Un-put-downable, breezed through it in 5 days (with work and other commitments etc. + it is like 1200 pages). I am now open to the idea of reading more historical fiction when previously I had just discounted the genre as being tacky. James Clavell has a real talent for such writing. His loose Asian Saga series of which Shogun is the first entry is now certainly on my list. I had forgotten how engrossing reading a book could be but I have to say that Shogun took me back to those summer vacations in middle school with the Chronicles of Narnia or Harry Potter in my hand. Also I realize I miss the feeling of holding a real hardcover in my hands. I love my kindle but it is not the same and never will be.
4. The Pearl (1947) - John Steinbeck
5. King Rat (1962) - James Clavell  
Went in expecting another Shogun and so the first 50 pages were a slog to get through. However, it quickly picked up. An epic adventure it is certainly not considering the entire book is set within the confines of a PoW camp.However, what it lacks in scale it makes up for in depth.
6. 11/22/63 (2011) - Stephen King  
Stephen King knows how to write huge books to grip you throughout.

### April

7. Born a Crime (2016) - Trevor Noah #  
Best part about it is how Trevor can explain complicated concepts (racism, crime, abuse) in a non judgemental, non preachy way that speaks to the heart. It also has comedic parts, not laugh out loud funny, but it has its moments. I want to read more memoirs now, think this might be the first I have ever completed.
8. Imperium (2006) - Robert Harris#  
My only regret is I could not get myself to read this book earlier. There is something magical about Rome, its people, its institutions, and overall structure of society that has captivated the imagination of men across millienea. And there is no man who deserves more to be the center of a work on Rome than Cicero. Granted that _Imperium_ is a historical fiction yet (from what the author claims) it meanders very little from actual recorded history and where it does, well, a little suspension of disbelief is not alien to anyone reading fiction, especially that about great men.  
The story of Cicero is the story of every man who having not been born and brought up in the shadow of power still dared to dream of one day achieving it.
9. Murder on the Orient Express (1934) - Agatha Christie !  
I wasn't planning on reading a murder mystery but thought I could do with a lighter read before starting Lustrum (although to be fair, Robert Harris isn't exactly a difficult author but even so). I had higher than usual expectations as this is one of the acclaimed novels of Agatha Christie. There was also the movie based on this book released in 2017 did $350m on the box office which is a lot of money for a 70 year old murder mystery. It is unfortunate that the whole book barring the last 40 pages was a slog to get through and completely contrary to my estimations. I have never been a fan of whodunnits that insult the readers intelligence by completely changing the entire scenario every chapter and that sadly is exactly what this book is. Fans of Law and Order may enjoy it?
10. Lustrum (2009) - Robert Harris
11. Dictator (2015) - Robert Harris  
The way I read them _Imperium, Lustrum_ and _Dictator_, they all seemed like the same book to me. Once I began the series, it was difficult to stop until I finished. I will give however say Imperium was the book most enjoyable to read, maybe it is because Cicero was younger and dropping his witticisms left and right, and more willing to take risks or perhaps since his best days were ahead of him it was more exciting to see how he would get there.
12. Eye of the Needle (1978) - Ken Follett  
Fun and exciting. A spy novel set during the closing stages of the second world war. Ken Follet writes well, I now look forward to reading his two highly rated historical fiction trilogies - Pillars of the Earth and The Fall of Giants . It is remarkable how Follet has achieved great acclaim in two very different genres of fiction - spy thrillers as well as historical fiction.
13. Siddhartha (1922) - Herman Hesse  
I'll be honest, my little brain can't comprehend. The sort of book which is best read in a literature class or a book club so you can have a long discussion afterwards. I do want to learn more about Hindu mythology now.
14. Fall of Giants (2010) - Ken Follett  
Fans of Downton Abbey will enjoy this. A thousand very entertaining pages, hard to stop reading.

### May

15. Stoner (1965) - John Williams #  
So bleak and full of sorrow and so real. From the first page to last. John Williams writes beautifully. Disclaimer: this novel will make you miserable, you will have to stop every chapter to just sit back and think . Not because this book is "academic" in character or difficult, it is in fact pretty easy to read and easy flowing enough to make you want to continue.

16. Fatherland (1992) - Robert Harris  
Wanted to take a break from reading "easy fiction" which unfortunately turned into a general hiatus from books altogether. So what book better to get back into reading than a Nazi thriller and which author more up to the task than Robert Harris (of Cicero Triology fame).

### June

17. Amar Bel (2000) - Umera Ahmed 


### July

18. I, Claudius (1934) - Robert Graves #  
Back to that Rome again. Although spanning the Julio-Claudian dynasty instead of the death of the republic. A gripping tale and what fine characters Robert Graves builds. I am not sure how loyal he has remained to historical considerations but it is not at all difficult to imagine that these events, bizarre as they seem, really did take place. My foray into historical fiction continues.

### August

19. Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources (1983) - Martin Lings

20. Claudius the God (1935) - Robert Graves

21. The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1963) - John Le Carre  
Reminded me a lot of Eye of the Needle, perhaps a little more on the psychological side.

22. Carrie (1974) - Stephen King  
This was King's first novel.

### September

23. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1974) - John Le Carre  
Not easy to read but oh so satisfying. The storytelling is far from &"linear", all over the place really and you have to really think and invest your mind to figure out what is happening.

24. Mindset (2006) - Carol Dweck

### November

25. The Nine Lives of Pakistan (2020) - Declan Walsh 

26. Shah of Shahs (1982) - Ryszard Kapuscinski #

### December

27. The Honorable Schoolboy (1977) - John Le Carre #  
This is my third Le Carre book and I have gotten quite used to his style now. And once you do, you can begin to really appreciate the masterpiece that you are reading through. Remarkable writing, so fluent and almost poetic. His descriptions of the Whitehall pencil pushers is always hilarious.

## 2021

### January

1. Smiley's People (1982) - John Le Carre  

2. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running (2007) - Haruki Murakami

### March

3. Things Fall Apart (1958) - Chinua Achebe #  
Have not been able to keep up with my readings lately. So I was looking for the sort of book that would put me back on track and 'Things Fall Apart' seemed ideal. Short, easy to read, and critically acclaimed on top. Having finished it, I can say that it exceeded expectations. Must read for all those who want to understand imperialism.

4. Jurassic Park (1990) - Michael Crichton #  
What a thrill! Could not stop.

5. Burmese Days (1934) - George Orwell #  
Three consecutive #s lol. It belongs right up there with his more famous works. Pity that it isn't. Orwell has captured the life of a colonial town so perfectly.

### April

6. In the Woods (2007) - Tana French !   
The ! is because the ending managed to piss me off sufficiently.

7. The Count of Monte Cristo - Alexandre Dumas  
Has to be the longest book I have ever read at more than 1300 pages. There is much to admire in this classic tale.

### July

8. How Asia Works (2014) - Joe Studwell #  
Highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of macroeconomics, public policy, development economics, industrialization and so much more! You can thank me later.

### December

9. Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage (1959) - Alfred Lansing
A true story for those looking for something inspirational. Shackleton was a great leader.

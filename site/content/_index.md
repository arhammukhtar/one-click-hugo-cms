## Welcome to my corner of the internet!

### &#128526;

This is where I'll share my essays, blogs and musings. I will mostly be writing about topics I am interested in which include AI, Neural Networks, Big Data etc.

My main inspiration is Paul Graham's famous blog (also the reason this is a static page site and not wordpress, as they say 'KISS') but mostly it is a way for me to improve my writing.

If you have any comments and suggestions, you can reach me at arhammuk@gmail.com.

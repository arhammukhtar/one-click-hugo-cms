I will try not to spoil the book but given the subject matter, that may prove to be a little challenging.

The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most famous, if not the most famous, novels of all time. Written by Alexandre Dumas in 19th century France. The story continues to inspire millions of readers almost two centuries onwards. 

The book is also a top suggestion on on-line forums given to people on the search for motivating books. This is for one very compelling reason. It gives readers the mental framework to believe that they can make drastic changes to their lives and find success no matter what their age may be. 

When the reader finds out that Edmond Dantes' has been able to impressively overcome the many years wasted incarcerated, he too makes a connection with his own circumstances. While his imprisonment may only be figurative yet he starts to imagine letting go of past burdens and beginning his life anew.

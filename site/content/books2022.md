1. The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett (1929)
It has been a long time since I was able to finish a book and I am very glad that I now did. The Maltest Falcon is a classic of the neo noir detective fiction genre.  
Reading this has made me want to read/re-read some Le Carre novel. 

2. The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler (1939)
This is the first book in the Philip Marlowe series. After The Maltese Falcon, perhaps it was an overkill to read another hard boiled detective fiction in such quick succession.

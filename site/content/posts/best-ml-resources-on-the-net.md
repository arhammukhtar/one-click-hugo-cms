I am studying a graduate level ML course this semester and so have been on the lookout for good resources (free) augment what I learn in class. I will be adding the most helpful ones here.

## Courses:
1. [Andrew Ng's CS229 Course at Stanford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-autumn2018.html)
Andrew is the most popular ML instructor on the planet. His method of teaching is such that the most difficult concepts become easy to understand! Plus we get class lectures videos, class notes as well as problem sets. 

## Videos:
1. [StatQuest's series on Machine Learning concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv9_4yMHFhI&list=PLblh5JKOoLUICTaGLRoHQDuF_7q2GfuJF)
For those of you who don't know, StatQuest along with 3Blue1Brown has the best popular maths channel on youtube. He has several videos on Machine Learning Concepts added to a playlist. This is not a curated course but you can watch the videos individually. 

## Books:
1. [Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani & Friedman](https://hastie.su.domains/ElemStatLearn/)
This book will give you the solid grounding in probability needed for excelling in any Machine Learning course and it is available for free!

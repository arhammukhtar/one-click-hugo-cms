Short Answer: It isn't

Long Answer: Deep Learning refers to a subset of Machine Learning techniques that rely on Deep (Neural) Networks. While the underlying theory and techniques have existed since the 1960s. They gained prominence recently because for the first time we had efficient algorithms and fast CPUs and GPUs to actually make use of neural networks. 

Today, Deep Learning is being utilized in computer vision, natural language and speech processing, self driving cars among many other disciplines.

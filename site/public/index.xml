      <description>Lately, I have been thinking about online arguments and if they serve any valuable function apart from being a source of entertainment for silent spectators.
The thought first came to my mind when I came across one of those classic liberal-conservative debate on reddit&amp;rsquo;s /r/india page. In this particular exchange one side was rude, insulting and frequently pedantic but the other guy continued to debate in good faith making his points clearly and politely.</description>

      <description>I will try not to spoil the book but given the subject matter, that may prove to be a little challenging.
The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most famous, if not the most famous, novels of all time. Written by Alexandre Dumas in 19th century France. The story continues to inspire millions of readers almost two centuries onwards.
The book is also a top suggestion on on-line forums given to people on the search for motivating books.</description>

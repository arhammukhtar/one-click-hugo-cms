The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most famous, if not the most famous, novels of all time. Written by Alexandre Dumas in 19th century France. The story continues to inspire millions of readers almost two centuries onwards.
The book is also a top suggestion on on-line forums given to people on the search for motivating books.</description>

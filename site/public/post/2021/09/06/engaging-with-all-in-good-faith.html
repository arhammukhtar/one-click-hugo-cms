    <p>Lately, I have been thinking about online arguments and if they serve any valuable function apart from being a source of entertainment for silent spectators.</p>
<p>The thought first came to my mind when I came across one of those classic liberal-conservative debate on reddit&rsquo;s /r/india page. In this particular exchange one side was rude, insulting and frequently pedantic but the other guy continued to debate in good faith making his points clearly and politely. I was amused at first seeing this do-gooder behave in such a manner but over time I have come to appreciate the power of this approach.</p>
<p>So I will list a number of reasons why we should continue to act in good faith even if we strongly suspect it is with a troll:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintaining our own sanity. If we are constantly trying to guess whether we are engaging with a troll we are wasting precious CNS resources that should be going towards more productive pursuits.</li>
<li>Insulting and ridiculing someone has never changed their minds. If you remain polite, you still have a chance of convincing them of their errors. (even if this chance is close to 1%)</li>
<li>Any argument on a social media website commands an audience of onlookers who may be on the fence on many issues. Your respectful demeanor and incisive arguments may cause them to move over to your side.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now with all that in mind, tell me, what is the harm in being polite?</p>
<p>P.S. if you are truly convinced that you are facing a troll then may I suggest you consider muting? It is very effective and works instantaneously. What never work is you trolling and haranguing right back.</p>
